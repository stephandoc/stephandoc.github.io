Welcome to my relatively new personal homepage. I use it mainly to present my newest research, share slides of talks and maintain a list of links to all R and Stata programs that were used in my publications (see Replication Files). 

<!-- I am also planning to shared interesting research findings that I found while doing research but never quite made it to a full publication.
 -->
Research
======
My research covers several areas within political sociology and sociology of education:
- Potential effects of ethnic "diversity" on social cohesion
- 
- The role of educational aspirations in educational inequalities
- 

Methods
======
I am using descriptive methods that try to combine various data sources to answer questions such as "did societies become increasingly more polarized, and along which dimensions?".

Furthermore, I advocate the use of current causal inference methodology, including clear definitions of causal research questions, flexible estimation methods and causal graphs. While the recent experimental turn in sociological methods greatly increased our causal knowledge, big sociological questions require an approach to adapt the experimental logic to large scale observational data.
