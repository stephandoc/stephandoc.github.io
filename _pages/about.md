Welcome to my new, and still unfinished, personal homepage. I use it mainly to present my newest research, share slides of talks and maintain a list of links to all R and Stata programs that were used in my publications (see Replication Files).

<!-- I am also planning to shared interesting research findings that I found while doing research but never quite made it to a full publication.
 -->

Research Topics
======
My research covers several areas within political sociology and sociology of education:
- Potential effects of ethnic "diversity" on social cohesion
- The role of family socialization for political attitudes
- Opinion polarization
- The role of educational aspirations in educational inequalities

Methods Focus
======
I focus on quantitative methods, including descriptive work and causal inference.

I am fond of encompassing descriptive methods. Social scientists have a wealth of data available, but often easy questions such as "has society polarized?" are surprisingly hard to answer. One reason is that there are few studies that combine various data sources.

Furthermore, I advocate the use of current causal inference methodology, including clearly defined causal research questions, flexible estimation methods and causal graphs. While the recent experimental turn in sociological methods greatly increased our causal knowledge, big sociological questions require an approach to adapt the experimental logic to large scale observational data.  Approaching these questions will never be as straightforward as analyzing clear cut experimental data. However, inferring causal knowledge from observational data involves comparing estimates that would occur under different causal models.
