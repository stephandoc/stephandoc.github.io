Welcome to my new, and still unfinished, personal homepage. I will use it to present my newest research, share slides of talks and maintain a list of links to all R and Stata programs that were used in my publications (see Publications).

Research Topics
======
My research covers topics in political sociology and the sociology of education:
- Ethnic "diversity" and its relation to social cohesion
- Opinion polarization
- Family socialization of political attitudes
- Ethnic educational inequalities and educational aspirations

Methods Focus
======
I focus on arbitrating between the field of causal inference and applied research by adopting new methods to longstanding sociological questions. This includes the formulation of clearly defined causal research questions, developing targeted designs for observational data, and the use of flexible estimation methods and causal graphs. I am also fond of an encompassing descriptive methodology, pooling various data sources and using a multitude of indicators, while also maintaining an eye for the details of specific cases.
